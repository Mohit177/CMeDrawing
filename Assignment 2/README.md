##Children's Park
This project is a part of our coursework in the course Computer Graphics(IS F311), under Dr. Tathagat Ray. It is a 3D simulation of a children's park, created using opengl libraries. Most of the object primitives are built using tranformations in opnegl, and some objects(like tree) are created using Blender and imported into the scene. <br> <br>
